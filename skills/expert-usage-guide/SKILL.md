# Expert Usage Guide

Use this skill when you need to decide which Creative Claw expert should handle a task, how to structure `invoke_agent(...)` parameters, or how to chain several experts together.

This skill is about routing and strategy. It does not replace the actual expert implementation.

## Core Rule

- Prefer built-in file tools and direct reasoning for ordinary coding, file editing, and lightweight analysis.
- Use an expert only when the task needs a specialized capability that is already productized in the system.
- When an expert has a structured parameter contract, always pass a JSON object string to `invoke_agent`.
- Prefer workspace-relative paths such as `inbox/...` and `generated/...`.

## Expert Selection Strategy

### `ImageGenerationAgent`

Use when:

- The user wants to create new images from text.
- No source image is required as the main input.

Recommended providers:

- `nano_banana`: default choice for general text-to-image generation.
- `seedream`: use when the user explicitly asks for Seedream or the task clearly needs that provider.
- `gpt_image`: use when the user explicitly asks for GPT Image / OpenAI image generation, or when the task should follow OpenAI-native image parameters.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"prompt":"a cinematic cat poster","provider":"nano_banana"}
```

```json
{"prompt":"a cinematic cat poster","provider":"seedream"}
```

```json
{"prompt":"a cinematic cat poster","provider":"gpt_image","size":"1536x1024","quality":"medium"}
```

Do not use when:

- The user wants to edit an existing image.
- The user first needs image understanding, grounding, segmentation, or prompt extraction.

### `ImageEditingAgent`

Use when:

- The user wants to modify one or more existing images.
- The task is "change this image", "replace background", "make it blue", "edit the uploaded image", and similar.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/source.png","prompt":["replace the background with a clean white studio"],"provider":"nano_banana"}
```

Use `input_paths` when several images or references are required.

Do not use when:

- The user wants a mask first.
- The user wants pure text-to-image generation.

### `ImageSegmentationAgent`

Use when:

- The user wants a mask, cutout, localized edit, region-only processing, or inpaint-style preparation.
- The task says "segment", "extract the subject", "generate a mask", "keep only the person", or similar.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/source.png","prompt":"person","threshold":0.2}
```

Key follow-up rule:

- After success, read `current_output.results[0].mask_path`.
- That `mask_path` is a reusable workspace file path for later tools or experts.

Typical chaining:

1. Call `ImageSegmentationAgent`.
2. Read `mask_path`.
3. Pass that workspace path to later editing or file-processing steps.

### `ImageGroundingAgent`

Use when:

- The user needs locations or bounding boxes, not a pixel mask.
- The task is to find where an object is in the image.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/source.png","prompt":"red handbag"}
```

Prefer this over segmentation when:

- Bbox information is enough.
- The next step only needs rough localization.

### `ImageUnderstandingAgent`

Use when:

- The user wants description, style analysis, OCR, prompt reverse engineering, or a combined understanding pass.
- The task says "describe this image", "read the text in this image", "analyze the style", "reverse prompt this image", or similar.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/source.png","mode":"description"}
```

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/source.png","mode":"all"}
```

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/reference.png","mode":"prompt"}
```

Prefer this before generation or editing when:

- The image contents are unclear.
- You need to understand a reference before deciding the next step.

### `TextTransformExpert`

Use when:

- The task is one atomic text transform only.
- The user wants rewrite, expand, compress, translate, structure, title, or script.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_text":"Launch a summer tea campaign.","mode":"rewrite"}
```

```json
{"input_text":"Launch a summer tea campaign.","mode":"translate","target_language":"zh-CN"}
```

### `VideoGenerationAgent`

Use when:

- The user wants a video generated from text or image-guided inputs.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"prompt":"make a cinematic cat video","provider":"seedance","mode":"prompt"}
```

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/first_frame.png","prompt":"animate this image","provider":"veo","mode":"first_frame"}
```

Do not use when:

- The task is only to generate still images.

### `VideoUnderstandingExpert`

Use when:

- The task is about understanding an existing video, not generating one.
- The user wants description, shot breakdown, OCR, or prompt reverse engineering from a reference video.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/reference.mp4","mode":"description"}
```

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/reference.mp4","mode":"prompt"}
```

### `SpeechRecognitionExpert`

Use when:

- The user wants audio or video converted into text.
- The task is transcript-first, not audio editing or synthesis.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/interview.wav"}
```

```json
{"input_path":"inbox/cli/interview.mp4","timestamps":true,"language":"en"}
```

### `SpeechSynthesisExpert`

Use when:

- The user wants text or SSML converted into spoken audio.
- The task is voiceover, narration, or TTS.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"text":"Hello from Creative Claw.","voice_name":"Vivi 2.0"}
```

```json
{"text":"这是一段产品视频解说。","voice_name":"解说小明 2.0","audio_format":"mp3"}
```

```json
{"ssml":"<speak>Hello<break time=\"500ms\"/>world</speak>","resource_id":"seed-tts-1.0","speaker":"zh_female_yingyujiaoyu_mars_bigtts"}
```

Notes:

- The default TTS resource is `seed-tts-2.0`; use `voice_name`, `voice_type`, or `speaker` for validated Seed TTS 2.0 voices.
- Pass `resource_id="seed-tts-1.0"` only for legacy speaker ids that are not in the Seed TTS 2.0 catalog.

### `MusicGenerationExpert`

Use when:

- The user wants a generated song draft or BGM clip from text instructions.
- The task is music creation rather than speech synthesis.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"prompt":"cinematic orchestral background music","instrumental":true}
```

```json
{"prompt":"warm folk pop song","lyrics":"custom lyric lines"}
```

### `SearchAgent`

Use when:

- The user needs external references, inspirations, or web facts.

Mode strategy:

- `image`: use for visual references.
- `text`: use for factual or conceptual information.
- `all`: use when both are helpful.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"query":"editorial fashion poster references","mode":"image"}
```

```json
{"query":"brand campaign visual strategy examples","mode":"text"}
```

### `KnowledgeAgent`

Use when:

- The task needs design thinking, art direction, prompt planning, or creative decomposition before execution.
- The user wants several visual directions, campaign ideas, or prompt sets.

Recommended parameters:

```json
{"prompt":"Design three visual directions for a premium matcha brand campaign"}
```

Prefer this before generation when:

- The task is underspecified.
- The user wants higher-level creative planning, not just direct rendering.

## Common Chaining Patterns

### Reference Image -> Better Prompt -> New Image

1. `ImageUnderstandingAgent` with `mode="prompt"`
2. `ImageGenerationAgent`

### Video Reference -> Understand -> Decide Next Step

1. `VideoUnderstandingExpert`
2. Then choose `VideoGenerationAgent`, `KnowledgeAgent`, or file tools based on the result

### Speech Media -> Transcript -> Script Rewrite

1. `SpeechRecognitionExpert`
2. `TextTransformExpert`

### Uploaded Image -> Understand -> Decide Edit Direction

1. `ImageUnderstandingAgent`
2. `ImageEditingAgent`

### Uploaded Image -> Segment Subject -> Local Edit

1. `ImageSegmentationAgent`
2. Read `mask_path`
3. Use `ImageEditingAgent` or built-in file/image tools

### Design Brief -> Creative Directions -> Final Rendering

1. `KnowledgeAgent`
2. `ImageGenerationAgent`

### Need Web References Before Rendering

1. `SearchAgent`
2. `KnowledgeAgent` or `ImageGenerationAgent`

## Routing Heuristics

- If the user says "generate", start from `ImageGenerationAgent`.
- If the user says "edit this image", start from `ImageEditingAgent`.
- If the user says "describe / OCR / analyze style / reverse prompt image", start from `ImageUnderstandingAgent`.
- If the user says "rewrite / translate / compress / title / script", start from `TextTransformExpert`.
- If the user says "find where", start from `ImageGroundingAgent`.
- If the user says "mask / cutout / segment", start from `ImageSegmentationAgent`.
- If the user says "analyze this video / break down shots / OCR video / reverse prompt video", start from `VideoUnderstandingExpert`.
- If the user says "video generation", start from `VideoGenerationAgent`.
- If the user says "transcribe audio / transcribe video / speech to text", start from `SpeechRecognitionExpert`.
- If the user says "text to speech / narration / voiceover", start from `SpeechSynthesisExpert`.
- If the user says "BGM / generate music / song draft", start from `MusicGenerationExpert`.
- If the user says "search references / web info", start from `SearchAgent`.
- If the user says "give me design directions / creative plan", start from `KnowledgeAgent`.

## Important Guardrails

- Do not call an expert just because one exists; choose it because it is the best fit.
- Do not use `ImageGenerationAgent` when the user clearly needs an image edit.
- Do not use `ImageGroundingAgent` when the next step truly needs a pixel mask; use `ImageSegmentationAgent`.
- Do not pass artifact names or vague labels when a workspace path is available.
- Do not invent unsupported provider names. Use only declared provider values.
